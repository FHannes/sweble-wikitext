/**
 * Denotes a definition list term.
 * 
 * While in HTML a definition list is a loose collection of terms and
 * definitions, the WOM interfaces also offer a more abstract view on a
 * definition list in which one or more definitions belong to a term.
 * 
 * Therefore, if one retrieves a term from a definition list, the definitions
 * that follow the term can also be addressed and altered through the term
 * interface (this interface).
 * 
 * However, the definitions that are considered part of a term are still
 * <b>not</b> children of that term! They are only attached to the term
 * "virtually". Altering definitions through the term interface will actually
 * alter the definition list to which the term belongs. If a term does not yet
 * belong to a definition list, definitions that get attached to the term will
 * be temporarily stored in that term (but not as its children) and will be
 * attached to the definition list once the term is attached to a definition
 * list.
 * 
 * Individual definitions are addressed using a zero-based integer index where
 * <code>0</code> denotes the first definition that follows this term in the
 * definition list. If this term is followed by another term in the definition
 * list and there are not definitions between the two terms, than this term does
 * not have any definitions.
 * 
 * Corresponds to the XHTML 1.0 Transitional element "dt".
 * 
 * <b>Child elements:</b> Mixed, [Inline elements]*
