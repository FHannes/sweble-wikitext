					[0] = " This sort of comment shows a lack of understanding of the history of all football codes.  No one says that Australian Football wasn't influenced by other codes, in fact, the reverse is true.  It was codified in 1859, which in the context of all the modern codes of football, is very early indeed.  It didn't just appear out of thin air, in fact, we know a lot about the people that first played it and who first formulated the rudimentary rules.  Almost without exception, they had had exposure to the English public school system - which is where we are to find the roots of almost all the modern football codes.  However, during the 1840s and 1850s, they all had their own separate and different rules.  So Australian Football is unique in that it was codified so early in the piece and that it was an amalgam of the experience of various wealthy Australians in the English public school system.  The biggest influence was clearly the Rugby school (and those who know both sports well will also be familiar with a lot of the shared terminology that is used that is not to be found in the other codes).  However, all these different school rules can be categorised roughly into two groups:  those that relied predominantly on kicking the ball (precursor to Association Football) and those that relied predominantly on running with the ball (Rugby).  Both Australian and Gaelic football share the characteristic that they are a combination of both groups - but that doesn't mean that one influenced the other - it's simply what they both got out of the various rules that were doing the rounds at the time.  It is worth mentioning that the modern version of Gaelic Football was codified a good 30 years after Australian Football.  All football historians have found no evidence of Gaelic football being an influence on Australian football.  This is unsurprising - remembering that the first ones to play the game all had an English public school background - how many of them were going to put their hand up and say let's play this Irish game I know!  This is not a partisan view, it is simply what we know of the history of the game.  Remember also that the first recorded game of Australian Football was between two wealthy protestant private schools - it is unlikely that any Catholics took the field that day!  --",

In fact, Canberra was an aussie rules stronghold until at least 1982 because the first two generations of public servants came predominantly from Melbourne. With time this balance swung more to Sydney and then around 1982 the Canberra Raiders joined the then NSWRL.  Rugby league certainly has overtaken aussie rules in general popularity (if you are counting TV ratings) but in terms of participation I would think that it would be roughly on par with aussie rules and rugby union, and all three are likely to be behind soccer.  In terms spectators attending games, I imagine the ACT Brumbies currently outstrip all, the Canberra Raiders only get about half, and for some of the three or four games the Kangaroos play in Canberra, they will often get more than the average Raiders game.  All in all - I think it is not an accurate statement about Canberra (not to mention that in souther NSW, aussie rules is stronger than rugby league).  --",

Factor in the class divide where your elite private schools play rugby union only, and breed staunch union supporters and you can see you're behind the eight ball already.

In a vicious cycle, these 'high end' company's are often run at the highest levels by graduates from the aforementioned elite schools and we know where their loyalties lie. (In a quick aside, my personal opinion is that in Australia, rugby union would be as much of an anachronism as royal tennis, if it weren't for the elite private schools keeping it alive all these years.) Good sponsorship like this leads to greater exposure, even if the actual level of support doesn't warrant it. The Sydney Morning Herald is a prime example. This paper concentrates on union and AFL at the expense of rugby league, it also has a very poor circulation compared to the other major Sydney paper, the Daily Telegraph."
